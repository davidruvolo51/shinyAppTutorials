## Motivation

In my early days of learning shiny, I kept a document of tips and tricks. It worked nicely, but it quickly became too cluttered and scattered. I decided to create this project to organize the material in to a series of practical examples and to make it available for the wider R community.

I am interested in web accessibility, data visualization and the communication of results, and good design practices. Many of the examples that I developed rely heavily on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript methods. I will try to keep things simple and provide links for further reading.

Suggestions for improvement are always welcome!

## Tutorials

I plan on developing a new Shiny app every now and then. Checkout the issues label `Tutorial Ideas` for examples that I'm currently developing or planning. New ideas are also welcome!

There are two types of examples: available and archived. *Available* examples are regularly maintained and updated. The *archived* examples still work, but the methods are outdated or the example was replaced by a newer one.

### Cloning Tutorials

You can clone the entire repository, but be aware that you will also clone the entire git history. You can either download the files or folders that you want or use `git sparse-checkout`. In the terminal, run the following commands.

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials
cd shinyAppTutorials
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set drag-and-drop
```

Replace `drag-and-drop` for the subdirectory that you wish to checkout locally. For more information, take a look at this GitHub blog post: [Bring your monorepo down to size with sparse-checkout](https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/).

### Archived Tutorials

The examples listed in the following table are achived. They still work, but they are either outdated or were replaced by a newer example. (I'm a bit hesitant to remove these examples in case some follows a link to a page that doesn't exist.)

<!-- begin:archivedTutorials -->
|name                    |description                                        |version |link     |

<!-- end:archivedTutorials -->

The internal links examples are outdated. Instead, use the `shinyLink` component described in the [Shiny Link](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials/tree/prod/shiny-links) subdirectory (02 August 2020).

## Resources

Many of the tutorials rely heavily on HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create specific layouts and interactivity. These are good skills to have, and they will come in handy when building custom applications. Throughout the examples, I've tried to keep things simple and provide links to outside sources where applicable. If something isn't clear or you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open a new issue.
