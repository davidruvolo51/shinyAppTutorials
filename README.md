# shinyTutorials

This repo contains the code for the examples and demonstrations presented on my shiny tutorials site: [davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/). 

## Motivation

In my early days of learning shiny, I kept a document of all my tips and tricks. It worked nicely, but it quickly became too cluttered and scattered. I decided to create this project to organize the material in to a series of practical examples and to make it available for the wider R community.

My interests are in web accessibility, data visualization and communication of results, and good design practices. Many of these tutorials focus heavily on html, css, and javascript, but I will try to keep things simple and provide links for further reading.

Suggestions, comments, ideas for improvement are always welcome!

## Resources

Many of the tutorials use css and javascript, as well as html to specific layouts and custom designs rather than shinyUI functions. These are good skills to have and will come in handy in future shiny development. Here are some links that you may find useful.
